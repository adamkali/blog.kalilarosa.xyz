# Starship

"The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell!".
I love this program. It creates great prompts for me to be able to create a truly unique to me experience that I really enjoy!

## The schema 

This will allow you to get some vscode auto completions. I dont know how to get this to do the thing with neovim.
``` toml
"$schema" = 'https://starship.rs/config-schema.json'
```

## Now for the format

Now i want to try a two line layout to be honest.
``` toml
format = '''
<$os$directory$git_branch$git_commit>
$rust$python$lua$golang$gleam$dotnet$bun$character '''
```

## The Colorscheme  

### Colors

Basically i want to be able to use my vaporlush theme that i really love! So just getting the lua code from my code editor: 
```lua 
--- @type Vaporlush.Palette
VaporPalette = {
    bg = '#0e102d',
    fg = '#079ef0',
    bg_highlight = '#0a2846',
    fg_highlight = '#5885ed',
    comment = '#8da0b8',
    primary0 = '#0700de',
    primary1 = '#0b03fc',
    primary2 = '#352ff5',
    primary3 = '#4e47ff',
    secondary0 = '#b50465',
    secondary1 = '#e60580',
    secondary2 = '#fa34a1',
    secondary3 = '#fc65b8',
    tertiary0 = '#3f10cc',
    tertiary1 = '#6439e6',
    tertiary2 = '#8864f5',
    tertiary3 = '#af95fc',
    quartary0 = '#fc5e03',
    quartary1 = '#fc853f',
    quartary2 = '#f59b67',
    quartary3 = '#ffb68c',
    gitsigns = {
        info = '#006655',
        add = '#00ccaa',
        change = '#e3307a',
        danger = '#c71e26'
    }
}

return VaporPalette
```
I think that it is very simpl to convert to a starship config.
``` toml
palette = 'vaporlush'
[palettes.vaporlush]
bg = '#0e102d'
fg = '#079ef0'
bg_highlight = '#0a2846'
fg_highlight = '#5885ed'
comment = '#8da0b8'
primary0 = '#0700de'
primary1 = '#0b03fc'
primary2 = '#352ff5'
primary3 = '#4e47ff'
secondary0 = '#b50465'
secondary1 = '#e60580'
secondary2 = '#fa34a1'
secondary3 = '#fc65b8'
tertiary0 = '#3f10cc'
tertiary1 = '#6439e6'
tertiary2 = '#8864f5'
tertiary3 = '#af95fc'
quartary0 = '#fc5e03'
quartary1 = '#fc853f'
quartary2 = '#f59b67'
quartary3 = '#ffb68c'
```
Now it is a simple matter of just activating the palette
