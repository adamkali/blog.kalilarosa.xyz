Hey it's me Adam Kalinowski, I have been doing some developing, maybe go and checkout what I have been [working on](/posts). Or if you you want to, read up on [how I became who I am](/about). 
Be sure to also check out my Configs [here](/configs) for some config files that I use, as well as some cool config recipes that you are more than welcome to steal.
And also stay classy.
