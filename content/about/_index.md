## Why might you like me? 
I prefer simplicity over complexity and elegance over flamboyance. I find that the best solutions are ones that are simple to imlement and simple to iterate on. I try to use Some aspects of clean code where needed, but I never try to form my entire tech stack over trying to create an interface before even needing one to solve the problem at hand. I will tell you when I think something was wrong, and I will tell you when i do not know the answer. 

And at the end of the day I try to remember that I am just a guy who has found the love of his life and wants to have a child soon.
