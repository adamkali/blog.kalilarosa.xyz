<p>My name is Adam Kalinowski, I am a software engineer at Legal Automation Systems. I like to call myself stupid; and I like that when I am corrected.</p>
<p>When I started college I was adamant on never writing a single line of code. I wanted to be A theoretical physicist. I wanted to write on a whiteboard and teach maths in front of a lecture hall. I wanted to give talks on my discoveries and be the best physicist in the world. I cannot tell you how many times that I was at least going to have to learn python even if I was going to be a theoretical physicist. I told them that I would never, <em>EVER</em> write a single line of code. Why? Because beneath me. I could do it without writing a single line of code.</p>
<p>Looking back: I don&rsquo;t think there has ever been a belief that I had held that I am happier for being wrong about, because two years later after I was able to go back to school with my own car at the University of South Florida, I started taking a class called: Astrophysics Lab. Part of the course was that i had to submit python scripts to run simulations. Slowly I got better at python, I started coming up with neat tricks and solving algorithms without knowing that they were already solved. I started trying to get better programming to impress this one girl in my class that I had a crush on. (We are now engaged!) I don&rsquo;t think that that was where I fell in love with software. No. That came some time mid semester.</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-itch">Getting the Itch</h2>
<p>I started work with a research group working on absorption in Metal Organic Framework Simulations, or MOFS for short. I started writing code in C, and started writing parallelized code to run on GPUs on the server. And this was a lot of fun. I had the ability to work on a codebase, yet something more Important happened then. I started write code in vim.</p>
<p>I became obsessed with writing everything in vim. Rewriting my class notes for home in Vim. Writing latex documents for homework in Vim. I even installed Arch Linux through ssh and configured the laptop through vim on an ssh client. I loved everything about the modal nature of it that a little green monster was growing in the back of my skull. Adam Kalinowski, The Physicist, became a Software Engineer.</p>
<p>And then I graduated in the spring of 2019. And I started looking for Physics jobs to get out of my parents house and try my hand at life. I was surprised to find out that there were not very many jobs for a fresh grad with a bachelor of science degree in physics. I know shocker right? So, while I started tutoring sat students, I started to teach my self more software engineering concepts. And working through the book: <em>Computational Physics: Mark Newman</em>. And i worked through the entire book and would sometimes post my answers to Github. But it made me understand why I was not getting a job in physics. I was not passionate about physics any more. I was only interested in becoming a Software Engineer. So when the pandemic hit and everything was remote. I started learning Django, React, Html, css, SQL, The whole thing, and I started getting far more interviews with companies. Yet, I was unable to show why I should be hired. And it was because I was not able to sell myself.</p>
<h2 id="becoming-a-salesman-for-myself">Becoming a Salesman for myself</h2>
<p>As a physics major turned software engineer, being a public speaker has never been my strong suit. I could really only tell a story when I was trying to write one. And being an interviewee was even a harder prospect for me. I was not someone who was able to brag about myself. I had confidence issues for my entire life and bragging about myself felt unjust. I was raised to be humble. And that made me dread trying to sell myself as better than anyone else because I thought I was just a beginner with no experience. I had imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>So I did the only thing that I could do. I asked someone what I should do. I asked my parents, and my girlfriend (now fiancee), and there was just one thing that stood out. My fiancee and mom told me that I should just be myself, and my Dad told me the quote at the top of this page</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to people to think you are the smartest in the room; make everyone else in the feel smarter. If you want everyone to think you are dumb; make them feel dumb.</p></blockquote>
<p>There was something about that quote that resonated with me. My late grandfather Zdzislaw Szewczyk, my dad would always said that he could make anyone feel smart. And if I wanted to someone to put me on their team, I should try to show them that I would need to show the interviewer not some polished version of myself. I had to make them see that I could be a team player that would make them proud.</p>
<p>So, when I interviewed at Legal Automation Systems, I shot my shot and decided to sell who I was. I knocked out the phone interview easy as pie. I knew how to do the coding project as if it was second nature. And when the in-person interview came along, I defended the project and had a blast with the team.</p>
<h2 id="the-waiting-game">The Waiting Game</h2>
<p>One day went by and I was working a 4 shift as a tutor, and then an 8 hour shift as a home help aide. No call. Next day a twelve hour shift with a 98 year old man named Jack Herman. I told him what was happening, and to be honest with you I had know idea if he was listening. Yet this time he was lucid and told me that he was sure that I was going to get the job. a couple more days of 12 hour shifts with Jack and I was starting to loose hope. Infact, I was scheduling a call with another interviewer. I got out of a 4 hour shift with tutoring, and then was running home for lunch before I had to get to another 12 hour shift with Jack and he had been particularly bad that week. And the interview that i was supposed to have the next day was postponned.</p>
<p>I got a phone call and was about ready to bite off the head of who ever called. I did not even read the call ID. I was such a zombie that I answered the phone with &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up&rdquo;. Brett my interviewer from Legal Automation Systems, called to offer me the job. I nearly broke down in tears: <em>I was now a Software Engineer!</em></p>
<h2 id="where-am-i-at-now">Where Am I at now</h2>
<p>After working as a Software Engineer for nearly 4 years at this point, I have developed a metric ton of skills. I have developed micro services in Dotnet, wrote lamda functions in python, worked on two Machine Learning models, with a third on the way, I wrote internal tools in Rust and Golang, and developed a Dotnet plugin for Neovim all to make my life a little easier. I am the Devops guy now at Legal Automation Systems, and have been working to move all our repositories to Gitlab to automat ci/cd. We just had a major release on our eFileMadeEasy site that was pushed with the new workflow. And the site didn&rsquo;t even go down!</p>
<p>I have worked in Linux, Macos, and Windows throughout this time and have had the time of my life doing it. You need me to write a docker container to deploy a cluster of it on ECS? Child&rsquo;s play. You want me to write a small Linux server for a service? I have the perfect solution. We need to research how to create a mobile app for analytics? I am your man.</p>
<p>Needless to say that I have grown into a developer that I thought was out of reach for me. And yet, there is so much for me to still do. But, now I can be reassured. I am a Software Engineer. And I am so happy that I was wrong about.</p>
