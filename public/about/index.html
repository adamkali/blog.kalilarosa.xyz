<p>My name is Adam Kalinowski, I am a software engineer at Legal Automation Systems. I like to call myself stupid; and I like that when I am corrected.</p>
<p>When I started college I was adamant on never writing a single line of code. I wanted to be A theoretical physicist. I wanted to write on a whiteboard and teach maths in front of a lecture hall. I wanted to give talks on my discoveries and be the best physicist in the world. I cannot tell you how many times that I was at least going to have to learn python even if I was going to be a theoretical physicist. I told them that I would never, <em>EVER</em> write a single line of code. Why? Because beneath me. I could do it without writing a single line of code.</p>
<p>Looking back: I don&rsquo;t think there has ever been a belief that I had held that I am happier for being wrong about, because two years later after I was able to go back to school with my own car at the University of South Florida, I started taking a class called: Astrophysics Lab. Part of the course was that i had to submit python scripts to run simulations. Slowly I got better at python, I started coming up with neat tricks and solving algorithms without knowing that they were already solved. I started trying to get better programming to impress this one girl in my class that I had a crush on. (We are now engaged!) I don&rsquo;t think that that was where I fell in love with software. No. That came some time mid semester.</p>
<p>I started work with a research group working on absorption in Metal Organic Framework Simulations, or MOFS for short. I started writing code in C, and started writing parellelized code to run on gpus on the server. And this was alot of fun. I had the ability to work on a codebase, yet something more Important happend then. I started write code in vim.</p>
<p>I became obsessed with writing everything in vim. Rewriting my class notes for home in Vim. Writing latex documents for homework in Vim. I even installed Arch Linux through ssh and configured the laptop through vim on an ssh client. I loved everything about the modal nature of it that a little green monster was growing in the back of my skull. Adam Kalinowski, The Physicist, became a Software Engineer.</p>
<p>And then I graduated in the spring of 2019. And I started looking for Physics jobs to get out of my parents house and try my hand at life. I was supprised to find out that there were not very many jobs for a fresh grad with a bachelor of science degree in physics. I know shocker right? So, while I started tutoring sat students, I started to teach my self more software enginerring concepts. And working through the book: <em>Computaitonal Physics: Mark Newman</em>. And i worked through the entire book and would sometimes post my answers to github. But it made me understand why I was not getting a job in physics. I was not passionate about physics any more. I was only interested in becoming a Sofware Engineer. So when Covid hit and everything was remote. I started learning Django, React, Html, css, SQL, The whole thing, and I started getting far more interviews with companies. I remember</p>
<p>As a physics major turned software engineer, I have found that I have a particular set of skills to be just who you need to find to solve a problem.</p>

<p>I prefer simplicity over complexity and elegance over flamboyance. I find that the best solutions are ones that are simple to imlement and simple to iterate on. I try to use Some aspects of clean code where needed, but I never try to form my entire tech stack over trying to create an interface before even needing one to solve the problem at hand. I will tell you when I think something was wrong, and I will tell you when i do not know the answer.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day I try to remember that I am just a guy who has found the love of his life and wants to have a child soon.</p>
