&lt;p>Everyone always tells you &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t reinvent the wheel.&amp;rdquo; Use existing frameworks. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste time building what already exists. And they&amp;rsquo;re probably rightâ€”for most people, most of the time. You aren&amp;rsquo;t going to do it any better than x engineers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But sometimes you need to prove to yourself (and any future potential employers) that you can actually build the wheel. Sometimes the best way to understand production-ready software is to build it yourself, exactly the way you want it to work. Sometimes problem-solving IS the point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Neorg Is Changing The Way that I Think</title><link>https://blog.kalilarosa.xyz/posts/neorg-is-changing-the-way-i-think/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 09:28:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kalilarosa.xyz/posts/neorg-is-changing-the-way-i-think/</guid><description>&lt;p>According to my imposter syndrome, I am an inexperienced software engineer. Yet when I look back through out the years, I have been a software engineer for almost &lt;strong>Six years&lt;/strong>. I began my journey as a student working on sorption simulations with large metal organic frameworks in a computational chemistry lab.
Now if you have ever worked on a supercomputer, you would know that you do not simply log onto a supercomputer ran by a university. You &lt;strong>ssh&lt;/strong> into the server, and run your code in the terminal by starting a job. So when I began as a resarch student I would write my code and then scp the file to my home directory of my instance. This was awful. However a graduate student that I was working with suggested learning how to use vim. That way I could do my programming in vim on the server.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
