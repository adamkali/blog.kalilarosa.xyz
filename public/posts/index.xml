      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a developer starts a new website, there are two events that occur. The developer will beset by horrific nightmares about styling the website. The other event is that the developer has fantastic dreams about how much better than they actually are about writing css. So when I saw that this website deployed on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://coolify.io/docs/&#34;&gt;Coolify&lt;/a&gt; instance did not have any styles what so ever even though locally I saw the styles. You know that I had to roll up my sleeves and just start making custom to my own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to my imposter syndrome, I am an inexperienced software engineer. Yet when I look back through out the years, I have been a software engineer for almost &lt;strong&gt;Six years&lt;/strong&gt;. I began my journey as a student working on sorption simulations with large metal organic frameworks in a computational chemistry lab.&#xA;Now if you have ever worked on a supercomputer, you would know that you do not simply log onto a supercomputer ran by a university. You &lt;strong&gt;ssh&lt;/strong&gt; into the server, and run your code in the terminal by starting a job. So when I began as a resarch student I would write my code and then scp the file to my home directory of my instance. This was awful. However a graduate student that I was working with suggested learning how to use vim. That way I could do my programming in vim on the server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
