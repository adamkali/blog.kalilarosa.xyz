      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to my imposter syndrome, I am an inexperienced software engineer. Yet when I look back through out the years, I have been a software engineer for almost &lt;strong&gt;Six years&lt;/strong&gt;. I began my journey as a student working on sorption simulations with large metal organic frameworks in a computational chemistry lab.&#xA;Now if you have ever worked on a supercomputer, you would know that you do not simply log onto a supercomputer ran by a university. You &lt;strong&gt;ssh&lt;/strong&gt; into the server, and run your code in the terminal by starting a job. So when I began as a resarch student I would write my code and then scp the file to my home directory of my instance. This was awful. However a graduate student that I was working with suggested learning how to use vim. That way I could do my programming in vim on the server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
