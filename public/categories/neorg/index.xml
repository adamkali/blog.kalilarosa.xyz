&lt;p>So one thing I had a problem with is getting my neorg notes to export to obsidian without manually having to specify the directory that it will be exported to. So here is a recipe for a script that I wrote for my neovim config that does just that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pragma">Pragma&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We start offcreate some tables and load in some libraries&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-lua" data-lang="lua">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="kd">local&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">norbsidian&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">{}&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="kd">local&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">builtins&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">require&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">&amp;#34;telescope.builtin&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="kd">local&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">pickers&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">require&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">&amp;#34;telescope.pickers&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="i-am-now-going-to-define-this-here-class-and-function">I am now going to define this here class and function&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now the NorbOptions class is a secret mousekatool to use later more on that later, but the norbsidian_export_template function just takes the inputs and gives us a pure function that will always generate the proper export.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Neorg Is Changing The Way that I Think</title><link>https://blog.kalilarosa.xyz/posts/neorg-is-changing-the-way-i-think/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 09:28:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kalilarosa.xyz/posts/neorg-is-changing-the-way-i-think/</guid><description>&lt;p>According to my imposter syndrome, I am an inexperienced software engineer. Yet when I look back through out the years, I have been a software engineer for almost &lt;strong>Six years&lt;/strong>. I began my journey as a student working on sorption simulations with large metal organic frameworks in a computational chemistry lab.
Now if you have ever worked on a supercomputer, you would know that you do not simply log onto a supercomputer ran by a university. You &lt;strong>ssh&lt;/strong> into the server, and run your code in the terminal by starting a job. So when I began as a resarch student I would write my code and then scp the file to my home directory of my instance. This was awful. However a graduate student that I was working with suggested learning how to use vim. That way I could do my programming in vim on the server.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
